-> Typescript can be more beneficial when:

	-> we have parametric functions.
	-> we have to return something from function.

-> Primitive datatypes are string, number, boolean, void, never.

-> TS doesn't force explicit annotation every place. For cases:

	-> If we are assigning a literal to the variable.
	-> The parameter of map() in arrays.
