-> A Stack is a SLDS (Static Linear Data Structure) abstraction that works on LIFO.

-> It is implemented on arrays using some functions:

	-> pop(index) : Deletes the given index element and returns it. Default behaviour is to pop last element (i.e., top element or front).

	-> push(element) : Appends the given element.

	-> top() : Returns the top element.
