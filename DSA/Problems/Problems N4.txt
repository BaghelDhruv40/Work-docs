PROBLEM STATEMENT: Find the Kth largest/smallest (Distinct one) element from the sequence.

    APPROACH 1: BRUTE FORCE

    -> Sort the sequence accordingly.

    -> Iterate till we get the Kth distinct element from the left.

    
        ANALYSIS:

        -> The time complexity is O(nlogn + n) i.e., O(nlogn).

        -> No auxiliary space is used.
        

    APPROACH 2: BETTER, OPTIMAL

    -> Use Max Heap or Priority Queue data structure.

        ANALYSIS:

        -> The time complexity is O(logn).

        -> Auxiliary space is used by the priority queue and so O(n) complexity.
