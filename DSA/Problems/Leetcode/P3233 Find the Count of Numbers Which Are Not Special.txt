"""	You are given 2 positive integers l and r. For any number x, all positive divisors of x except x are called the proper divisors of x.

A number is called special if it has exactly 2 proper divisors. For example:

The number 4 is special because it has proper divisors 1 and 2.
The number 6 is not special because it has proper divisors 1, 2, and 3.
Return the count of numbers in the range [l, r] that are not special.

 

Example 1:

Input: l = 5, r = 7

Output: 3

Explanation:

There are no special numbers in the range [5, 7].

Example 2:

Input: l = 4, r = 16

Output: 11

Explanation:

The special numbers in the range [4, 16] are 4 and 9.

 

Constraints:

1 <= l <= r <= 109

My views: For now i don't know the solution of it. But what i'm thinking is that, no prime number is a special number according to the definition of it. 1 is also not a special number. Now the task remains to find such numbers which exactly have one more divisor besides 1 as 1 is the divisor of every number.

See, if prime numbers can't be special, what about their squares? Square of a prime number will definitely be a special number. And i think, this is the answer of it.
