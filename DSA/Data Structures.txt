WHAT ARE DATA STRUCTURES ?

-> Before jumping to data structures, one thing to realise is that every data structure holds data, and, every data has a type. This data type is nothing but primitive datatypes.
Of course we can make complex data structures which may hold non-primitive datatypes too.

-> Primitive datatypes are simplest datatypes and are named so as they can't be further classified into simplest form. Example: integers, float, characters,, boolean, etc.

-> The term data structure basically signifies non-primitve datatypes like arrays, collections (other linear datatypes like list, tuple, etc), trees, graphs.

CLASSIFICATION OF DATA STRUCTURES

-> We classify datastructures broadly as Linear and Non linear.

	LINEAR: These datastructures are logically linear as they store data in continuous (one-by-one or sequential) manner and traverse linearly also. They include:

		-> List:
		-> Array:
		-> Queue:
		-> Stack:
		-> Tuple:
		-> String:
		-> Set:

	NON-LINEAR: These datastructures
