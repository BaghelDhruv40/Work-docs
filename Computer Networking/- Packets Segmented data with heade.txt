-> Packets: Segmented data with headers.

-> Packet Switches: That routes the packets. They take the incoming packet from one link and route them to other place through outgoing link. Most famous example of it are Routers and Link-layer switches.

	-> Routers are used in network core.

	-> Link layer switches are used in access networks.

-> Access Network: The physical link(s) that connects the host to the first router (called edge router).

-> Internet Protocol (IP) : It specifies the format of the packets that are sent and received among routers and end systems. 

-> IETF: Internet Engineering Task Force developed the Internet Standard in the document RFCs (Request Fro Comments).

-> IEEE: The IEEE 802 LAN/MAN Standards Committee [IEEE 802 2009], specifies the Ethernet and wireless WiFi standards. 

-> API: End systems attached to the Internet provide an Application Programming Interface (API) that specifies how a software piece running on one end system asks the Internet infrastructure to deliver data to a specific destination software piece running on another end system. The Internet API is a set of rules that the sending software piece must follow so that the Internet can deliver the data to the destination software piece.
