FUNCTIONS IN NETWORKING

-> We can classify functions for two processes to inter-communicate with each other in following way:

	MANDATORY: Minimum requirements. Below are some of them

		-> Error control: Surety of correct message delivery.
		-> Flow control: Buffer sizes shouldn't overflow.
		-> Access control
		-> Multiplexing and Demultiplexing
		-> Addressing

	OPTIONAL: Required for specific situations. Few are listed below

		-> Encoding/Decoding: For privacy purposes.
		-> Check pointing: Required for large files.
		-> Routing: Alternative way (flooding) is default choice.


ISO-OSI MODEL
-----------------------

-> This is a standard model that describes how all the networking function should be implemented.
	-> Provides Encapsulation.
	-> Provide Abstraction
	-> Based on Divide and Conquer Strategy.
	-> Testing of functionalities is easy.

-> There are seven layers. They are listed below in "top to bottom":

	-> Application Layer: For user interface.
	-> Presentation Layer: For user interface.
	-> Session Layer: For user interface.
	-> Transport Layer: Contains most number of functionalities.
	-> Network Layer: Complex Calculations.
	-> Data-link Layer: Deals both on H/W and S/W.
	-> Physical Layer: Deals only on hardware.

DATA-LINK LAYER
-------------------------
-> Hop to Hop connectivity.


NETWORK LAYER
------------------------

-> This layer takes the responsibilities of:

	-> Host to Host connectivity: How one host can be connected to another host.

	-> Logical addressing: Addresses that are valid throughout the world.

		-> In TCP/IP, it is the IP address.
		-> At data-link layer, we use physical address which are limited to the hosts in a network.

	-> Switching: Simply means the logical or algorithm to connect all devices and the decision to send the packets to correct user with less physical medium.

	-> Routing: A procedure of building routing table. In contrast, using the routing table (or some other method) is called switching.

	-> Congestion control

	-> Fragmentation: Fragmenting the frame size if it exceeds certain limit of transfer frames.

-> Below is the detailed discussion of above topics in NL.

	SWITCHING
	------------------
	-> It is of three types:

		-> Circuit Switching

		-> Packet Switching

			-> Virtual circuits
			-> Datagram

		-> Message Switching

	-> Circuit switching is not the part of Network layer. It was used since way before OSI model.

		CIRCUIT SWITCHING
		------------------------------


TRANSPORT LAYER
---------------------------

-> This layer has the following responsibilities:

	-> End to End Connectivity: Process to process connectivity. Requires Port Numbers.

	-> Flow Control: The way we control sender to send the packet more than the receiver's capacity. SR is the protocol for that.

	-> Error Control: Check Sum is used.


	-> Segmentation:

	-> Multiplexing/De-multiplexing

	-> Congestion Control


SESSION LAYER
-----------------------

-> This layer has the following responsibilities.

	-> Authentication & Authorization.

	-> Checkpointing: Used in Large data.

	-> Synchronization

	-> Dialogue Control

	-> Logical grouping


PRESENTATION LAYER
-----------------------

-> This layer has the following responsibilities.

	-> Character Translation: Translating text encoding for two computers communicating.

	-> Encryption/Decryption.

	-> Compression
