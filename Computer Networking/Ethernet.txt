-> One of the LAN Technology. Used popularly in 1980s.

-> Standard Ethernet was proposed by IEEE 802.3

-> Topology used was Bus. Now switch is used.

-> Acces control method used is CSMA/CD.

-> No acknowledgement is used.

-> Data rate was 10Mbps initially. Then we got 100Mbps (called fast ethernet) and then 1Gbps (called Gigabit Ethernet).

-> Encoding technique used is Manchester.

-> Operates at Data link layer.

ETHERNET FRAME FORMAT
--------------------------------------
Below is the description and correct sequence of components of the frame:

	-> Preamble: A 7 Bytes long bit stream of 101010....

		-> This is added by Physical Layer.

		-> The reason it is so long is that it was assumed that it would not match with any data.

	-> SFD: A 1 byte long bit stream 10101011. It is also added by Physical Layer.
