-> What is Software Testing?
Ans. Indeed testing is done to ensure the software is operating as per the expectations and without any errors. But, that's the purpose of testing and not testing itself. I liked this perspective about testing, great.

    "Testing is a process of executing the program with the intention of finding faults in it."

Indeed this definition is incomplete as it is not considering a software but a program. We already know the difference between them so yes software testing includes much more work then just on programs.

A book states that the most appropriate definition of ST should be like,

    "Software testing is the process of verifying the outcomes of every phase of software development and validating the program by executing it with the intention of finding faults."
