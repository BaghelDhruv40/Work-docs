-> The mechanism by which server sends dynamic content introduces two classifications, namely, "Client-side Rendering" and "Server-side Rendering".

SERVER-SIDE RENDERING
---------------------
-> It is the default behaviour of web to handle web requests and response.

-> The whole web page is created first on the server itself and then send to the client.

-> The client system renders the page.


CLIENT-SIDE RENDERING
---------------------
-> It is a mechanism introduced for the efficiency of dynamic content updation.

-> Web pages are now designed in such a way that only the relevant changes get affected. This thing requires:

    -> A mechanism on the client side that updates only the relavant changes and not the whole page.

    -> A mechanism on the client side that sends a web requests just for relevant data and handling it.

    -> A slight change in the workload of the server to just send the requested things in a suitable format.
