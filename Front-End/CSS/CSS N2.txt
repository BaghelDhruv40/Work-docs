ATTRIBUTE : box-sizing
--------------------------------
-> content-box: If set to this, any width and height when applied will affect the content area only. The sizes given to any other area will be added upon these parameters.

	for example: If we set an element's width to 100 pixels, then the element's content box will be 100 pixels wide, and the width of any border or padding will be added to the final rendered width, making the element wider than 100px.

-> border-box: If set to this, any width and height when applied will affect the border area. Hence, the child element may remain fit in the parent element content edges. It tells the browser to account for any border and padding in the values you specify for an element's width and height. 

	for example: If we set an element's width to 100 pixels, that 100 pixels will include any border or padding you added, and the content box will shrink to absorb that extra width. This typically makes it much easier to size elements.



ATTRIBUTE : height
---------------------------
-> max content: this makes the height of the container just enough to contain all the content present in the div.
-> fit content : this makes the height 
-> min content
