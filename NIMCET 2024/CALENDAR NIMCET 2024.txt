							CALENDAR NIMCET 2024

TYPES OF YEARS
1. Leap Year: 366 Days = 52 Weeks + 2 Extra days
2. Normal Year: 365 Days = 52 Weeks + 1 Extra day.


POINTS TO LEARN
1. 100 Years -> 5 Odd days : Any 100 years can be divided by 4 to find the number of leap years but in that the years having 00 in the end will only be leap year if they are divisibe by 400. So, In 100 years, there are only two possibilities, 24 and 25 leap years.
Out of 100 years, say 24 are leap years and 76 are normal. So odd days will be given by 24*2 + 76*1 =124 = 5 odd days.

2. 200 Years -> 3 odd days: Same Logic.

3. 300 Years -> 1 Odd day.
4. 400/800/1200/1600 and so on Years -> No Odd days.
