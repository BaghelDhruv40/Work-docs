				SYLLOGISM NIMCET 2024

	

SYLLOGISM: Some statemets are given and Conclusions are given.

SYLLOGISM METHODS

1. Vein Diagram method.
2. AIE method.
3. 100-50 method.
4. other methods such as

a) Positive-Negative method: 

	- if statements are +ve and +ve then conclusions are +ve.
	- if statements are +ve and -ve then conclusions are -ve.
	- if statements are -ve and -ve then no conclusion.

b) All-Some-Some Not-No (100-50 method) :

	- All -> 100 50
	- Some -> 50 50
	- Some Not -> 50 100
	- No -> 100 100

c) Income-Expenditure method: Assign Income to statements and Expenditure to Conlusions.

	- I=E
	- I>E

4) If two words are in same sentence, we don't merge two sentence.

5) This rules help in merging two sentences. The common element through which two sentences are merged must have 100 atleast on one. Otherwise two sentence will not be merged.

6) Either-Or Case: We check for this when both conclusions are wrong. We check
1. Elements must be same in both conclusions.
2. One must be +ve and other must be -ve.
3. Full (All, No) and Half (Some, Some not).

POINTS TO REMEMBER

1. If % are used then,
	1. 0% -> No
	2. 100% -> All
	3. Any percentage besides these -> Some

2. If other words are used instead of All, Some, No,Some not, then
	1. If it interprets as full -> All. For example: Each, Every, etc.
	2. If it interprets as half -> Some. For example: Few, A few, The few, 	   	 	 	Ocassionally, Generally, little, etc.
	3. Only -> All. for example: Only A are B -> All B are A.
	4. Only a few -> Some or Some not. 
	For example: Only a few cats are dogs -> Some cats are dogs or Some cats are not 	dogs.
	5. Can never be -> No or Some not.
For example: All cats can never be dogs -> No cats are dogs or Some cats are not dogs.
note: Mostly "All" is used with "can never be". In that case we use "some not".
