1. If average kinetic energy is proportional to temperature of the system in thermal equilibrium, does it means that particle having different 
velocities in a system have theirown associated different temperature?
2. If different particles have different velocities, is it possible to find the number of particles having particular velocity or their 
probability distribution?
3. The temperature of the isolated system remains time independent and constant homogenously. So many collisions are happening within the system.
The number of identical particles in the system is constant. Is the linear momentum of the whole system conserved?
4. Velocity of each particle need not be same and if i look at a certain portion of the system, since temperature is same, the average 
distributuion of velocities or kinetic energy must also be same?
5. Changing the Kinetic energy of the system changes the momentum?
6. For a system in thermal equilibrium, each particle has equal kinetic energy and the relation between the square of rms speed of any particle
and the temperature of the system is linear.
7. For two systems, of different kind of gases, at thermal equilibrium with each other, heavier gas has lower rms speed particles.
