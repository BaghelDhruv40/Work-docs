Optical fibers are classified based on their refractive index, materials used, and mode of propagation of light .
Based on the refractive index, there are two types of optical fibers: step index fibers and graded index fibers. Step index fibers consist of a core surrounded by the cladding, which has a single uniform index of refraction. Graded index fibers have a refractive index that decreases as the radial distance from the fiber axis increases .
Based on the materials used, there are two types of optical fibers: plastic optical fibers and glass fibers. Plastic optical fibers use polymethylmethacrylate as a core material for the transmission of light, while glass fibers consist of extremely fine glass fibers .
Based on the mode of propagation of light, there are two types of optical fibers: single-mode fibers and multi-mode fibers. Single-mode fibers are used for long-distance transmission of signals, while multi-mode fibers are used for short-distance transmission of signals .
