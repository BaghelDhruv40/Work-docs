Through ER Model, we learned how to make tables out of the diagram. The relationship was denoted using foreign key references.
One may ask why to take the headache of jumping through multiple tables to search for an attribute? Why don't we just make a table having all the attributes?

	-> Redundancy: Repetition of values for certain attributes.

	-> Insertion/Updation: Inserting the values in such a large attributes table will be hard.
