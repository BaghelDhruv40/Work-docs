-> Some of the most important SQL commands: 

	-> SELECT - extracts data from a database
	-> UPDATE - updates data in a database
	-> DELETE - deletes data from a database
	-> INSERT INTO - inserts new data into a database
	-> CREATE DATABASE - creates a new database

	-> CREATE TABLE - creates a new table
	-> ALTER TABLE - modifies a table
	-> DROP TABLE - deletes a table
	-> CREATE INDEX - creates an index (search key)
	-> DROP INDEX - deletes an index

-> We have the following datatypes in SQL:

	-> NUMERIC: Number, Float, Int, Real, Decimal, Binary Float, etc.

	-> CHARACTER: Char, Varchar, Nchar, Nvarchar, Long, Raw, Long Raw, etc.

	-> DATE: Date, Time, Timestamp, Interval

-> We have 7 constraints in SQL:

	-> Not Null: The field for an attribute can't be null

	-> Unique: The fields in each tuple for an attribute must be unique.

	-> Primary Key: A not null and unique attribute.

	-> Foreign Key: A unique constrained attribute with null values allowed and is used for reference in another relations.

	-> Check: To check for conditions on the attribute.

	-> Default: To set default value for an attribute.
