Regular expressions are special characters or set of characters that can be used in pattern matching for search purposes.

In linux, they are used with commands like grep, sed, tr, vi.

Here are some basic regular Expressions:

	-> Dot (.) : Matches any one character except the new line.

		example: echo 'cat filename | grep app.e`		# finds words like apple, appae, app1e

	-> Caret (^) : Matches the start of the string.

		example: echo `cat file | grep ^B`		# words starting with B

	-> Dollar ($) : Matches the end of the string.

		example: echo `cat file | grep $e`

	-> Asterisk (*) : Matches zero or more occurrences of its preceedor.

	-> Backslash  (\) : Escapes the following character.

	-> Braces ( () ) : Matches or search for a set of regular expressions.

		example: echo ` cat file | grep b{ed,all,ad}s`	#matches beds balls bads

	-> Question (?) : Matches exactly one character in the string or stream.
