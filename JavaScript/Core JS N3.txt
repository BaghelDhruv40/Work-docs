-> The picture of JS got cleared when I researched about origin of web and HTML. HTML uses tags. These tags must be declared and defined somewhere somehow to be able to understood. There was a language which being used to create such markup language. So, browsers used to parse an HTML document and understood those tags based on the specifications defined by <!DOCTYPE html>. The DOM used to be created according to this specification only. Later version fo HTML (specifically 5) made a whole new transition from parsing HTML to define HTML tags within the browsers. Hence, HTML5 was possible by making the tags of HTML as the c/c++ classes. At this point, The browsers knows HTML. Later, to provide mechanism for manipulating the DOM, APIs were built in c/c++ to be used by some language to manipulate DOM. Why some language? why not c/c++ itself? See; C/C++ requires compilation. Hence, it makes the task harder and slower. That's how JS got introduced. JS was the language that utilized the DOM APIs to manipulate it. JS was introduced as completely interpreted language.
